# Semantic Priming Effects During Naturalistic Reading: Multiple Semantic-Primers or Just One?
This study attempts to investigate the apparent blurry boundaries of the semantic priming effects during naturalistic reading. Data was collected on children between the ages of seven and nine (n = 278) on decoding errors made during a naturalistic passage reading task. The main goal of this study is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine if words could potentially have multiple seman-tic-primers or if words are only limited to just one semantic-primer. Semantic-similarity scores were calculated for each content word within each passage using one of two methods: (a) calculating se-mantic-similarity scores between target words and the preceding content word (paired semantic-similarity score), and (b) calculating semantic-similarity scores between target words and all preceding content words within the same sentence (coherence semantic-similarity score). Multivariate regression models were conducted to determine whether either of the two variables predict word decod-ing errors after controlling for word length and word frequency. Additionally, the amount of unique variance explained by each of the two variables was also computed. Both variables were predic-tive of word reading errors after controlling for word frequency and word length. However, coherence semantic-similarity scores seemed to explain more unique variance when compared to paired semantic-similarity scores. These results suggest that there may be multiple semantic-primers for each target word, and that there may be a blurry boundary to semantic-priming effects
