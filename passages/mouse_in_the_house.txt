Once there was a mouse. He lived in a wall of an old house. Each night the mouse went to the kitchen. He wanted to find something to eat. The man who lived in the house heard the mouse. He knew the mouse lived in the wall. But he didn't mind. 
Then one day the man decided to sell the house. He loved the old house. But it was too big. He put an ad in the paper. It said, "100-year-old house for sale. Call 224-3414." Many people called and wanted to visit the house. Two people came on Sunday. They walked up the old stairs. When they got to the top, the mouse ran down the wall. He ran up and down the inside of the wall. Up and down. The people heard the mouse. They said, "We don't want the house." The mouse was very happy. He was afraid that new people would try to get rid of him.
Every time someone visited the house, the mouse would do the same thing. He would run up and down the wall between the first and second floors. Every time, the people left without buying the house. Then a family came to see the house. The house was just the right size for them. When they walked up the stairs, the mouse ran up and down the wall. They heard him and said, "Oh, you have a mouse. We love the house so much we'll buy it, mouse and all."
