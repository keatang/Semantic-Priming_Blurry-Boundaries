Toads can be found in almost every part of the world. Freezing temperatures cause unsafe conditions for these cold-blooded animals. In northern climates, toads hibernate all through winter. They protect themselves by making nests underground. Toads sleep in those nests all day. They are mostly awake after dark. That is when the hunt for food takes place. Toads eat mostly bugs and worms. In some places, they have learned to try new foods. Toads capture prey with their sticky tongue. They hunt on land and in water. Toads have odd eyes that help them to swim and hunt in low light. Their eyeballs have a seethrough lid, which enables them to see underwater. Their vision is really good at spotting movement, even in a murky pond or on a cold, moonless night. But a toad's eyesight is not very sharp. An insect can be standing right in front of the toad and as long as that bug stays very still, the toad will not see anything. But as soon as the insect moves, the toad will suddenly react. In an instant, the long sticky tongue will dart out and eat the victim. The hunter's aim is spot-on, so it catches many snails, slugs, and flies. In many parts of the world, toads are considered to be pests. A long time ago, humans used to bring toads on ships to new lands. In those days, humans used to believe that toads would eat the bugs that like to eat crops. But without natural predators, toads quickly grew in numbers. Now, toads harm local habitats by eating up all the food. They also harm many animals who try to eat them. The animals do not know that toads have poison in their skin. So now, humans are trying to get rid of toads in gardens and parks.
