All people have five senses. People have eyes, ears, a nose, a mouth, and hands. Each of the senses is part of the brain. The brain makes the senses work. People hear with their ears. People see with their eyes. They smell with their noses. They taste with their mouths. People touch things with their hands. But, without the brain people would not see, hear, smell, taste or touch. The brain makes all our senses work.
