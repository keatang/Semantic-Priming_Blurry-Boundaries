Sam's birthday was in two days. He was going to be seven years old. He wanted a Play Station game. He also wanted a new bike. But most of all he wanted a dog. His father went to look for a present. First, he went into the toy store. He saw the Play Station that Sam wanted. But his father didn't have enough money. Then he saw a red bike that Sam would love! But that also cost too much. He drove to the animal care center. It was hard to choose just one dog. All of them looked cute. Finally he sat down outside of a cage. A brown fuzzy puppy came up to him. The puppy put his paw on the cage. It seemed like he was saying, "Take me home!" Sam's father thought, "Ok, little pup, I'll take you home."
He paid for the puppy and they put a HOLD note on his cage.
The next day, Sam and his dad went for a ride. His father drove to the animal care center. Sam didn't understand why they were there. When they walked in there was the brown fuzzy puppy. 
The worker gave Sam the puppy and everyone sang, Happy Birthday. 
It was the best birthday ever!
